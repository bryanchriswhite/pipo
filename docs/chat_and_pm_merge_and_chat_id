+ Need to be able to create and join private chats the same way as regular chats
+ Private chats are currently referred to by their array hash initially so that they can be created immediately and referenced by the client
  + Is this needed?


Finding a private chat from Client
  + Possible states:
    + We don't have the chat cached locally
    + We have the chat cached locally
      + It has been initiated?
      + It has not been init'd (will this ever happen?)
        + Do we ever want to cache a chat or PM but not open it? Is there a point in this?
  + What do we know?
    + The chat participants
