Concepts

- Membership
Membership is what allows a user to join a room that is private

- Active
  User.active - Boolean
Active should reflect whether the user is currently online or offline.
Online is defined by a user having a current socket connection
Offline is defined by a user having no active sockets

(We may should have a period where if the user disconnects without sending
the proper disconnect message, the server waits for a period of time for
the user to reconnect before marking them disconnected. We can add this at
a later time however)

- Subscribed
Subscribed is a setting that will give the user updates for a room while they are not signed in
This should be default (maybe?) set when you are added to a room or join a room for the first time
Should be able to turn it off and not have it turn back on again unless you explicitly turn it on




TODO:
updateActiveUsers might should be renamed to sendActiveUsersUpdate

need to create a method that updates the active users for a room, or
for all rooms.

When we send the activeUsers data to a client on join or update, are
there any places where we missed updating activeUsers?

We need to add setting user.active to true or false when...
 - User connects (to any socket)
 - User disconnects (to any socket)

Need to update room._activeUsers when...
 - User joins a room
 - User parts a room
 - User starts a private chat
 - User leaves a private chat



- User connects to socket

- User authenticates
	- Mark user as active

- User joins a room
  - Private room
		- Check room._members, room._admins, & room._owner and continue if we find user
		- Add member to room._activeUsers
		- Add user to room._subscribers

- User parts a room

- User disconnects

- User disconnects without parting all of their rooms
